# My Portfolio Website

Welcome to the repository of my custom-made portfolio website. This website showcases my frontend and full-stack projects, demonstrating my proficiency and skill set in web development.

## Technologies Used

The website is primarily built using:

- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- Flowbite React
- Nodemailer

## Features

The website has been designed to display my work in a structured and visually appealing manner. It includes:

- **Introduction**: A brief introduction about me and what I do.
- **About Me**: A brief detailed description about me, my skills, and my experience.
- **Work Projects**: A showcase of my full-stack project I helped develop requiring cross-team collaboration with UI/UX Design Team and the Data Science Team. The technologies used for the application are available and a link to view and access to the live app. 
- **Projects**: A showcase of my frontend and full-stack projects. Each project includes a brief description, the technologies used, and links to the live site and the source code. I routinely update and swap out some older projects to better display my current skillset as a developer.
- **Contact**: A contact form viewers can use to send me a quick message via email.
